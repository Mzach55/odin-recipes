<h2>Description!</h2>
<p>On my journey to becoming a master chef during quarnintine, I discovered this
    delicious and easy to cook Pan-Seared Steak recipe. I promise you all, this will be
    one of the best homecooked meals you will ever have. Since it is partially cooked
    under a tasty amount of Garlic Butter, it will be very flavorful! Also there is a ton of room
    for adaptaion with this recipe. For example, you could add multiple vegetables like Aspargus, Broccoli etc.
